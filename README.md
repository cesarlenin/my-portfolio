### Summary
 I love coding because the work I do is something I can proudly stamp my name on. Encountering roadblocks and overcoming them gives me a sense of euphoria.I like a challenge.The greater the struggle, the better.It is what keeps me coming back.I want to be part of a team to tackle bigger projects and trade knowledge with other passionate people.

When Iâ€™ m not coding, I am most likely reading or exercising.For reading, I like self - development or business books and manga.As a workout, I like lifting weights or practicing Brazilian Jiu - Jitsu.On occasion, I relax watching anime, riding my motorcycle or going on long hikes.
